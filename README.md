# Sublime Text 3 Arc-Dark theme

Once I'm done and figure out how to package this properly you won't have to do this below.

1. Clone repository & extract archive
2. Place *Arc-Dark* folder in *Packages/User*
3. Open *Arc-Dark-Master.sublime-theme* with an editor and replace all custom asset paths with your own (unless default assets are used)
4. Place `Widget.sublime-settings` in Packages/User
5. add `"theme": "Arc-Dark-Master.sublime-theme"` to your user prefs file.
6. add `"color_scheme": "Packages/User/Arc-Dark/schemes/Arc.tmTheme"`, to your prefs file or add through the user menu
